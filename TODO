psgi.input streaming

    * add a "read_cb()" method to the psgi.input handle as an extension?  EV
    gets to schedule the watcher in that case rather than bleeding the fd to
    the handler.

allow streaming responses to be HTTP/1.0 "Connection: close" rather than
HTTP/1.1 "Transfer-Encoding: chunked".

    * maybe match up the streaming flavour with the request version?

Handle requests that don't require a body.

Better EV-callback error handling.
